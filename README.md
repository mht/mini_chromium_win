mini_chromium_win
=================

Inspired by [mini_chromium][1] from Mark Mentovai (Chromium team). mini\_chromium\_win is a small collection of useful low-level ("base")
routines from the Chromium open-source project at
http://www.chromium.org/ . Unlike [mini_chromium][1], mini\_chromium\_win is for Windows.

## Goal
- Eliminate unnecessary code
- Take care of API incompatibility between major version, such as v22 -> v23. According to Chromium team, 'base' is not design for reuse of other projects.

## Non-Goal
